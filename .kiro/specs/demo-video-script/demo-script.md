# Pick For Me - Yelp Hackathon Demo Video Script
## Duration: 2:30 - 3:00 minutes

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:20)
**Visual:** Show a frustrated person scrolling endlessly through restaurant options on their phone, looking overwhelmed

**Voiceover:**
"We've all been there. You're hungry, you open a food app, and suddenly you're drowning in choices. 47 Italian restaurants. 83 sushi places. Which one is actually good? Which one fits your budget? Which one is even open right now? Decision fatigue is real, and it's exhausting."

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:20 - 0:45)
**Visual:** Split screen showing:
- Left: Traditional apps with endless scrolling, filters, reviews
- Right: Person looking stressed, time passing on clock

**Voiceover:**
"Traditional recommendation apps give you options, but they don't make decisions. They show you 50 restaurants and say 'good luck choosing.' You spend 20 minutes reading reviews, comparing prices, checking locations... and you're still not sure. What if there was a better way?"

---

## SOLUTION INTRODUCTION (0:45 - 1:05)
**Visual:** 
- Smooth transition to Pick For Me landing page
- Show the clean, bold neo-brutalism design
- Highlight the simple chat interface

**Voiceover:**
"Meet Pick For Me - the AI that actually picks for you. No endless scrolling. No decision paralysis. Just tell us what you want, and we'll make the decision. Built with Yelp's powerful AI API, Pick For Me doesn't just recommend - it decides, explains, and even books for you."

---

## CORE DEMO - FEATURE 1: CONVERSATIONAL AI (1:05 - 1:35)
**Visual:** 
- Screen recording of the app in action
- User types: "I want Italian food for dinner, under $50"
- Show the AI processing
- Display the AI Decision Card with confidence score

**Voiceover:**
"Here's how it works. You describe what you want in plain English - no complicated filters or forms. Our AI, powered by Yelp's conversational API, understands your preferences instantly. But here's the game-changer: instead of showing you 20 options, we pick ONE. The best one. With 92% confidence."

**Visual:**
- Zoom in on the decision reasoning
- Highlight the factors: rating, price match, distance, cuisine match

**Voiceover:**
"And we tell you exactly why. Exceptional 4.8-star rating. Perfect pricing. Ideal location. This isn't a random pick - it's an intelligent decision based on real data from Yelp's extensive business database."

---

## CORE DEMO - FEATURE 2: AUTONOMOUS BOOKING (1:35 - 1:55)
**Visual:**
- Show the "Book Now" button being clicked
- Display booking confirmation
- Show alternative options if needed

**Voiceover:**
"But we don't stop at deciding. Click 'Book Now' and we handle the reservation through Yelp's Reservations API. Fully autonomous. From question to table in under 60 seconds. And if your first choice isn't available? We've already got alternatives ready."

---

## UNIQUE VALUE TO YELP (1:55 - 2:20)
**Visual:**
- Show statistics/metrics overlay
- Display different use cases: tourist, local, business traveler
- Show the multi-category support (hotels, attractions, transportation)

**Voiceover:**
"Here's what makes Pick For Me special for Yelp. First, we solve the paradox of choice - more options don't always mean better decisions. By confidently picking the best option, we increase conversion rates and reduce user drop-off. 

Second, we demonstrate true agentic AI - not just answering questions, but taking actions. This is the future of AI assistants.

Third, we work for everyone - tourists who don't know the area, locals tired of the same spots, business travelers in a rush. Universal appeal."

---

## TECHNICAL CHALLENGES & INSIGHTS (2:20 - 2:45)
**Visual:**
- Show code snippets briefly
- Display the decision engine architecture
- Show API integration points

**Voiceover:**
"During development, we discovered critical insights about Yelp's AI API. The conversational context is powerful, but decision-making logic needs careful tuning. We built a sophisticated scoring algorithm that weighs rating, distance, price, and cuisine preferences - because the AI needs to be confident, not just accurate.

We also found that Yelp's API excels at understanding natural language but needs structured decision frameworks for autonomous actions. Our decision engine bridges that gap, turning recommendations into commitments."

---

## CLOSING & IMPACT (2:45 - 3:00)
**Visual:**
- Show happy user enjoying their meal
- Display the Pick For Me logo
- Show tagline: "Stop Choosing. Start Living."

**Voiceover:**
"Pick For Me isn't just an app - it's a new paradigm. We're not giving users more information. We're giving them their time back. We're turning Yelp's incredible data into confident decisions. Because sometimes, the best choice is letting AI choose for you.

Pick For Me. Stop Choosing. Start Living."

## REAL PROBLEMS WITH YELP API (TO MENTION)

### 1. **Decision vs Recommendation Gap**
**Problem:** Yelp AI API is excellent at understanding queries and providing recommendations, but lacks built-in decision-making logic for autonomous selection.

**Our Solution:** We built a sophisticated decision engine that scores businesses across multiple factors (rating 30%, price 25%, distance 20%, cuisine 15%, popularity 10%) to confidently select ONE option.

**Judge Impact:** "We identified that Yelp's AI needs a decision layer to truly be agentic. Our engine bridges that gap."

### 2. **Confidence Communication**
**Problem:** Users need to trust AI decisions, but Yelp API doesn't provide confidence scores for recommendations.

**Our Solution:** We calculate confidence based on score differentials between options and display it prominently (85-98% range).

**Judge Impact:** "For AI to make decisions, users need to trust it. We engineered confidence metrics that make autonomous decisions feel safe."

### 3. **Context Preservation Complexity**
**Problem:** Multi-turn conversations require careful context management that isn't automatically handled.

**Our Solution:** We built a conversation context system that tracks user preferences, previous interactions, and decision history.

**Judge Impact:** "We enhanced Yelp's conversational AI with stateful context management for truly intelligent multi-turn interactions."

### 4. **Booking Integration Friction**
**Problem:** Moving from recommendation to reservation requires multiple steps and user actions.

**Our Solution:** One-click booking that seamlessly integrates Yelp Reservations API with our decision engine.

**Judge Impact:** "We reduced the path from 'I'm hungry' to 'table booked' from 5+ minutes to under 60 seconds."

### 5. **Location Intelligence**
**Problem:** Location data needs to be enriched with context (tourist vs local, time of day, distance preferences).

**Our Solution:** Smart location scoring that adapts to user context and travel patterns.

**Judge Impact:** "We made location-aware decisions that understand not just where you are, but who you are and what you need."

## IMPROVEMENTS YELP COULD MAKE (CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK)

### 1. **Built-in Decision Engine**
"Yelp AI API could benefit from an optional decision mode that returns a single confident choice instead of multiple recommendations, with explainable reasoning."

### 2. **Confidence Scores**
"Adding confidence metrics to API responses would help developers build more trustworthy autonomous systems."

### 3. **Booking State Management**
"Tighter integration between AI API and Reservations API could enable fully autonomous booking flows without custom orchestration."

### 4. **Context Persistence**
"Built-in conversation context management would simplify multi-turn interactions and enable more sophisticated agentic behaviors."

### 5. **Decision Factors API**
"Exposing the factors that influence recommendations (why this business over that one) would enable better decision-making UIs."
