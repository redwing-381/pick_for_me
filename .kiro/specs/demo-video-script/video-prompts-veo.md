```
A cinematic 8-second video clip showing a creative visualization of decision paralysis.

Elements multiply and spin faster, creating a chaotic vortex of information. The person's silhouette remains still while the digital chaos intensifies around them. Particles and light trails connect the floating elements. Modern, slightly futuristic aesthetic with neon-style glows. Dramatic lighting with rim light on silhouette.
